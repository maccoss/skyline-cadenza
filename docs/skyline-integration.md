# Skyline integration

How Cadenza connects to a running Skyline document, what it reads from the
document, and what it writes back. The user-facing surface is the
"Connect to Skyline" / "Load from Skyline document" / "Update Skyline
document" buttons in the Cadenza UI.

## Transport: JSON-RPC over a named pipe

Cadenza talks to Skyline through Skyline's own JSON-RPC server (the same
transport `SkylineMcpServer` uses upstream). When Skyline launches an
external tool from `Tools > External Tools`, it passes the pipe name as
`args[0]`. The pipe name Skyline hands out is the LEGACY ToolService pipe
name; the JSON server listens on a derived name with the
`SkylineMcpJson-` prefix. `SkylineSession.FromArguments` transforms the
incoming `args[0]` to the JSON pipe name before connecting; connecting to
`args[0]` directly hits the legacy binary server and the first read comes
back as `JsonReaderException: 0x00 is invalid start of value`.

The session is a connect-per-call factory, NOT a long-lived connection.
Every call to `SkylineSession.Execute` opens a fresh pipe, makes the
request, and disposes. This matches Skyline's upstream usage; holding the
pipe open across calls works for the first request and then fails with
`0x00 is invalid start of value` after idle because Skyline expects each
exchange to be self-contained.

If `args[0]` is missing (developer launching the .exe standalone), the
session falls back to scanning `~/.skyline-mcp/connection-*.json` for any
running instance and uses the most recently connected one.

## What Cadenza reads from the document

When the user clicks "Load from Skyline document", `SkylineLibraryLoader`
runs a single custom report against the live document to fetch one row per
`(peptide, charge, fragment)`. From those rows it materialises a
`Candidate` list:

- Peptide identity: `PeptideModifiedSequence`, `PrecursorCharge`,
  `PrecursorMz`, `ProteinName`. Modification syntax is normalised through
  `NormalizeModifiedSequence` so DIA-NN, Carafe, and Skyline forms collapse
  to the same key.
- Fragment list: `ProductMz`, `ProductCharge`, `LibraryIntensity`. The
  top-6 fragments by intensity per `(peptide, charge)` survive into the
  candidate's `Fragments` array; the top-4 by m/z become the
  `Top4Fragments` the scheduler uses for the fragment-clash check.
- Retention time: peptide-level only. Per-replicate columns
  (`PredictedResultRetentionTime`, `BestRetentionTime`) multiply rows by
  the replicate count and blow up on documents with many imports. The
  loader probes `PredictedRetentionTime`, `LibraryRetentionTime`,
  `AverageMeasuredRetentionTime`, `BestRetentionTime`,
  `PeptideRetentionTime`, `RetentionTime` in that order and picks the
  first whose sample of 200 values contains a non-zero entry. The user
  can override the column from the UI if none of the candidates work.
- Peak boundaries: pulled from the active BLIBs Skyline has attached to
  the document. `SkylineBlibDiscovery` reads the document's library list
  (BLIBs by priority order), and `BlibRetentionTimeReader` pulls per-
  peptide `startTime` and `endTime` from each BLIB's `RetentionTimes`
  table. Cadenza takes the union of every replicate's boundary (widest
  start, widest stop) as the candidate's `RtStart` / `RtStop`. The
  scheduler's time padding (a drift buffer) is then layered on top,
  NOT on the peak
  shape itself but on cross-acquisition drift between the source data
  and the new run.

  If no BLIB row exists for a peptide, the boundary is synthesised as
  `RT +/- peakHalfWidthMin` and the candidate is reported in
  `PeptidesFromSynthesizedBoundaries`.

The loader also caches the BLIB paths it consulted on the result; the UI
prints them on the status bar so the user can sanity-check that the
peak-boundary source was what they expected.

## What Cadenza writes back

The "Update Skyline document" button runs `UpdateSkylineAsync`, which
does four things in sequence. Each step is gated on the previous one
succeeding.

### 1. Save guard

Cadenza refuses to push if the Skyline document hasn't been saved. The
assay BLIB needs to live at a stable on-disk path next to the `.sky` file
so Skyline's library registration sticks across saves; writing to `%TEMP%`
made it look like the registration had worked (Skyline reports success on
the `RunCommand` call) but the registration silently dropped the next
time the document was saved. The user is told to save first and retry.

### 2. BLIB write

`BlibAssayWriter.Write` emits a self-contained BiblioSpec
non-redundant `.blib` next to the user's `.sky` file:
`Cadenza-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.blib` (local time, since assay names are
per-workstation unique and a local timestamp is more readable to the
user). The BLIB is schema version 8 (the version that introduced
`RefSpectra.startTime` / `endTime`):

- `RefSpectra`: one row per scheduled peptide, holding the top-6 library
  fragments as the reference peak list (zlib-compressed BLOBs of
  little-endian doubles for m/z and floats for intensity), plus the
  candidate's RT apex and the per-replicate scheduling window
  (`startTime` / `endTime` from the BLIB or the scheduler's padded
  window if synthesized).
- `Modifications`: UniMod IDs in the modified sequence are translated to
  monoisotopic mass deltas before being written. BiblioSpec's
  `LibKeyModificationMatcher` chokes on `C[UniMod:4]` with `FormatException`
  ("The number 'UniMod:4' is not in the correct format"); writing
  `C[+57.0]` instead avoids the matcher's int-parse path. The mass
  deltas come from a hardcoded UniMod table covering Carbamidomethyl
  (4), Acetyl (1), Phospho (21), Oxidation (35), and several others.
- `Proteins` + `RefSpectraProteins`: the protein-group identifier per
  scheduled peptide, so Skyline's library viewer can roll spectra up to
  proteins.

The `SqliteConnection` uses `Pooling=False`. `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`
pools connections by default, which keeps the underlying file handle
open on Windows even after the `using` block disposes the connection.
Tests that delete the file straight after the write hit
`IOException: file is being used by another process` without this.

### 3. Library registration

The BLIB is attached to the running document via a single `RunCommand`
call:

```
--add-library-path=<blib path>
--add-library-name=<assay name>
```

This routes through Skyline's `CommandLine.SetLibrary(name, path)`, which
calls `LibrarySpec.CreateFromPath` to dispatch on the file extension
(`.blib` -> `BiblioSpecLiteSpec`) and appends to
`PeptideSettings.Libraries.LibrarySpecs`. Cadenza initially tried the
JSON-RPC `AddSettingsListItem("Libraries", ...)` path, which fails because
Skyline's `JsonToolServer.DeserializeSettingsItem` looks for a static
`Deserialize(XmlReader)` on the generic argument of `SettingsListBase<T>`,
and for the Spectral Libraries list `T` is the abstract `LibrarySpec`
(which has no such method, only its concrete subclasses do). The
`RunCommand --add-library-*` path is the routes-around-it workaround.

The `--add-library-path` is sent BEFORE `--add-library-name` in the same
batch. They're documented as order-insensitive (SkylineCmd parses all args
before running handlers), but in practice the library was sometimes
leaving the active list unattached when name came first. Path-first turns
out to be stable.

### 4. Settings configurator

`SkylineSettingsConfigurator.ConfigureAsync` derives a recommendation
from the scheduled candidates (precursor charge set, fragment charge set,
peptide length range, ion types y/b/p, MS1 isotope filter, RT filter
tolerance) and applies it through `RunCommand` calls. Each flag goes in
its own batch except for the two mutual-validation cases:

- DIA acquisition method + `Results only` isolation scheme are bundled
  because `TransitionFullScan.DoValidate` rejects each one alone:
  isolation-scheme without DIA throws "No other full-scan MS/MS filter
  settings are allowed when precursor filter is none"; DIA without
  isolation-scheme throws "An isolation window width value is required
  in DIA mode".
- MS1 precursor isotope filter (`Count` + threshold + analyzer + ppm)
  goes in one batch because Skyline runs `ValidateRes` against the
  combined end state.

The configurator's `Recommendation` record is also stamped into the
status bar so the user can see exactly which settings Cadenza pushed.
The `ToUiInstructions` fallback writes the same recommendation as
click-by-click Skyline UI instructions in case a flag fails on an
older Skyline version.

### 5. Transition-list import

`PeptideTransitionListBuilder.Build` emits a peptide-style transition
list CSV (header: `Protein Name`, `Peptide Modified Sequence`,
`Precursor Charge`, `Precursor m/z`, `Product m/z`, `Product Charge`,
`Explicit Retention Time`, `Explicit Retention Time Window`, `Note`).
Each scheduled precursor produces:

- 3 precursor isotope rows (M+0, M+1, M+2). Skyline recognises a
  transition where `Product Charge == Precursor Charge` and the product
  m/z is at the precursor's monoisotope spacing as a precursor
  transition; mass step is the 12C -> 13C neutron offset
  (1.003355 Da / charge per isotope step).
- Up to 6 fragment rows (`FragmentsPerPeptide == BlibAssayWriter.PeaksPerSpectrum`),
  each carrying its real `FragmentIon.Charge`. An earlier build
  hardcoded `Product Charge = 1` and Skyline rejected the +2 y/b
  fragments DIA-NN selects on longer tryptic peptides with
  "no matching product ion".

The CSV is written to `%TEMP%` and imported with
`RunCommand --import-transition-list=<path>`. The import is slow
(~10 transition rows/sec) because Skyline's `MassListImporter` rebuilds
the document tree per protein; this is on the Skyline team to address.
Cadenza shows a heartbeat status every 10 s with the elapsed time and
ETA so the UI doesn't look hung. The temp CSV is deleted in `finally`.

## Failure modes the user might see

- "Save the Skyline document first ...": step 1 guard.
- "BLIB written ... but registering it with Skyline failed: ...": step 3
  reported a non-empty stdout containing "Error" or "conflict". The
  message includes Skyline's verbatim output and tells the user to add
  the library manually via Peptide Settings then re-run the push.
- "library registration failed: RunCommand --add-library-* threw: ...":
  the JSON-RPC pipe itself errored. Usually means Skyline crashed or the
  pipe closed; reconnect from the Skyline button and try again.
- Library appears registered but doesn't show up in the Peptide Settings
  dialog: known cosmetic bug in Skyline's settings dialog cache. The
  library IS attached (the document XML and a fresh "Update Skyline
  document" push both confirm it); closing and reopening the Peptide
  Settings dialog forces a refresh. Nick Shulman has a fix planned for
  a future Skyline release.
